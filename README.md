# Analyze-Survey-Data
Project 2 of the Udacity Data Foundations Nanodegree (DFND)

# Project Description
In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier (please do not analyze by hand - it will take forever!).

Prepare with the descriptive statistics and spreadsheets lessons leading up to the project.

# Project Specifications
- Submission Phase
- Exploration Phase
- Communication Phase

**Submission Phase**:

*The student has uploaded all files necessary for review.*
- A PDF report has been uploaded and a excel workbook has been uploaded in a single zipped folder file

**Exploration Phase**:

*The student is able to pose questions and use data to answer them.*
- The project clearly states four or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis. The solutions to the questions should range in being found from a single column to being found using multiple columns.
- At least one question/solution must make use of multiple columns.

*The student is able to calculate measures of center for quantitative data.*
- Student uses means, medians, and modes to generate insights.
- Stating the mean, median, and mode is insufficient. Please include in the written description a short insight related to each one.

*The student is able to calculate measures of spread for quantitative data.*
- Student uses standard deviation and range to generate insights.
- Stating the standard deviation and range is insufficient. Please include in the written description a short insight related to each one.

*The student is able to build graphs for quantitative and categorical data.*
- Student uses at least two different plots to explore the data. These plots may include histograms, box-plots, scatterplots, and bar charts to explore data and gain insights.
- All slides must contain a visualization. Screenshots of values in a table does not count.

The student is able to present findings in an understandable way.
- An appropriate visual is chosen to present the data. All labels are legible and the visual has appropriate axis labels.

**Communication Phase**:

*The student is able to avoid making inferential or causal statements when using descriptive statistics.*
- The results of the analysis are presented such that any limitations are clear. The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.
- The results do not imply facts about a larger group of individuals based on descriptive values. Language is only applied to the specific data provided. Unless a correct analysis beyond the course material is conducted that allows for inference.
- This data is from Survey Respondents and is not from the entire Udacity Student population. This must be acknowledged at least once in the submission.

*The student is able to choose the correct analysis or plot for a given data type.*
- The analysis associated with answering a particular question uses the appropriate variables, summary statistics, and plots that could provide an answer.
